<p>Hello, I'm Calvin, an aspiring recent college graduate who is striving to learn and grow in the IT field. My recent experience in the coding boot camp have roused me even more in the IT field especially programming. To begin with, I really like the people I met through this camp. Not only I learn a lot from them, but socialzing and having enjoyable moments with like-minded people was the greatest part of the camp for me. Working with people of this unique and amiable nature makes me look forward to be in a fantastic, friendly, and collaborative work enviroment in the near future.</p>

<p>So why I find programming exciting? First, is the sheer joy of making something unique.</p>
